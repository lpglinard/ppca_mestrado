# Improving Software Quality Through Gamification Techniques

**Authors:** Lucas Linard, Sergio Antonio Andrade de Freitas

This secondary study aims to identify and analyze primary studies concerning how gamification techniques, such as points, badges, and rankings, affect software quality, especially code quality.

## Planning

This systematic review aims to investigate the influence of gamification techniques on software quality within the software development industry. Specifically, it aims to identify which gamification elements, such as points, badges, and rankings, are commonly employed and to assess their effectiveness in improving software quality metrics, particularly code quality.

### PICOC

- **Population:** Software engineers
- **Intervention:** Gamification
- **Comparison:** Control group inside the same company not using gamification techniques
- **Outcome:** Quantity of issues found by SAST analysis
- **Context:** Industry of software development

### Research Questions

1. Which gamification techniques are often used to improve software quality?
2. Which indicators/metrics are used to measure the impact of gamification on code quality?
3. How are indicators/metrics used to measure the impact of gamification on code quality?
4. How does gamification impact code quality?
5. What is the effect of gamification techniques on software development lead time?

### Selection Criteria

#### Inclusion Criteria:
- Papers focused on the application of gamification specifically in software development processes, software engineering, or related areas.
- Studies published within the last 10 years (or adjust according to scope) to ensure recent and relevant data.
- Studies written in English or Spanish to maintain consistency and accessibility.

#### Exclusion Criteria:
- Studies focusing on gamification in unrelated fields (e.g., education, healthcare, non-software-related industries).
- Studies for which the full text is not accessible, as these cannot be analyzed in depth.

### Quality Assessment Checklist

#### Questions:

- Does the conclusion adequately summarize the main findings and provide clear answers to the research questions posed?
- Does the study provide quantitative evidence of lead time improvement (e.g., statistical analysis or percentage change)?
